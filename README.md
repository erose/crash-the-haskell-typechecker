# crash-the-haskell-typechecker

### Instructions

This Haskell code causes the typechecker to loop forever at compile time. Run `stack build` and see.

### Explanation

Inspired by https://aphyr.com/posts/342-typing-the-technical-interview and https://wiki.haskell.org/wikiupload/d/dd/TMR-Issue8.pdf. See the latter for a well-paced introduction to what's going on in general.
